/specify I am building a modern podcast website. I want it to look sleek, professional, and stand out. Should have a landing page with one featured episode. There should be an episodes page, an about page, and a FAQ page. Should have 20 episodes, and the data is mocked - you do not need to pull anything from any real feed. Translate the generated Markdown into Traditional Chinese and save it as a new file.
```

```md

```

```md
/plan I am going to use Next.js with static site configuration, no databases - data is embedded in the content for the mock episodes. Site is responsive and ready for mobile. Translate the generated Markdown into Traditional Chinese and save it as a new file.
